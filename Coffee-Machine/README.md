# hs-Coffee-Machine

Programming a coffee machine simulator. <br>
The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; <br>
if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. <br>
You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. <br>
Since nothingâ€™s for free, it also collects the money. <br><br>
NOTE: runs both in command-line and IDE console. <br><br>
